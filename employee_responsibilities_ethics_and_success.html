<h1>Employee Responsibilities, Ethics, and Success</h1>
<img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1811/29903299538_8c081c0bde_k.jpg" alt="An individual with a Sweeto Burrito hat with his head turned the side, smiling">
<h2>Mandated Reporting</h2>
<p>As a member of the Skils&rsquo;kin team working with a vulnerable population, you are considered a mandated reporter. As a mandated reporter, you must report any suspected incident of abuse and neglect. If you see signs of abuse or neglect or both, or happen to witness signs of abuse or neglect, you need to report it immediately to Adult Protective Services/Complaint Resolution Unit and your supervisor. If you report directly to APS/CRU, please notify your supervisor of the incident immediately. You will be given specific departmental training on what to look for and reporting procedures.</p>
<h2>Conflict of Interest</h2>
<p>All employees should avoid situations that might cause their interests to conflict with Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s interests or might compromise our integrity and reputation. A conflict of interest occurs when you or an immediate family member use your position at Skils&rsquo;kin for personal benefit through an investment, association, or business relationship that interferes with your ability to exercise independent judgment on behalf of Skils&rsquo;kin.</p>
<p>Full-time employees are discouraged from accepting second jobs outside, whether self-employment or otherwise. All employees holding or considering second jobs must obtain written permission from their immediate supervisor in order to ensure that the job will not create a conflict of interest or interfere with the proper performance of their duties.</p>
<p>Employees are strongly discouraged from accepting gifts from salespeople, vendors, suppliers or any other type of solicitor. An exception would be if the employee were to be provided a meal during a business meeting or sales presentation. Other exceptions may be approved by your supervisor.</p>
<h2>Code of Ethical Conduct</h2>
<p>The purpose of Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s Ethical Code of Conduct is to provide guidance and set common ethical standards for our employees and officers to adhere to on a consistent basis.</p>
<h3>Business Practices</h3>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s policy is to conduct our business affairs in an ethical, impartial, honest and proper manner. Self-interests and personal desires will not interfere with teamwork or fairness.</p>
<h3>Human Resources</h3>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin understand the importance of its human resources &ndash; this is why we are committed to maintaining a professional and diverse workforce.</p>
<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>When marketing services and products to the public, Skils&rsquo;kin employees will be transparent, honest, and respectful. In promoting our services or products be respectful to employees, clients, and individuals including their cultural beliefs and values. We will protect confidential information and respect the privacy of our employees and participants.</p>
<h3>Illegal and Unethical Acts</h3>
<p>Our commitment to integrity begins with complying with laws, regulations, and rules where we do business. Skils&rsquo;kin employees follow an internal Fraud and Abuse Policy and are required to report fraud, bribery, theft, falsification of records and other wrongdoing. Good faith reports of illegal or unethical acts will be kept anonymous, if desired, and can be made without fear of retaliation.</p>
<h3>Conflicts of Interest</h3>
<p>All Skils&rsquo;kin employees must avoid situations that create a conflict of interest or the appearance of one. Our employees understand that these conflicts might compromise our integrity and reputation.</p>
<h3>Gifts and Money</h3>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin employees are strongly discouraged from accepting gifts from salespeople, vendors, suppliers or any other type of solicitor. Furthermore, giving or receiving expensive and/or meaningful gifts is not appropriate in the professional environment, even with the best of intentions.</p>
<h3>Professional Boundaries</h3>
<p>We understand that in any professional relationship there is an innate power imbalance that arises. Our clients and individuals trust our staff to be professional and act with their best intentions in mind. Skils&rsquo;kin staff must ensure that as advocates we encourage and assist our participants in building and maintaining healthy boundaries.</p>
<h3>Selling and Solicitation</h3>
<p>No non-employee is allowed to come on to the property of Skils&rsquo;kin to survey, petition or distribute literature to employees. In addition, Skils&rsquo;kin employees may not solicit for any purpose, at any time, in any work area during working time.</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>In the spirit of open communication, Skils&rsquo;kin employees are encouraged to ask questions and to get advice from their supervisor, the Human Resource Department, the Compliance Manager or the CEO.</p>
<h3>Employee Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Each Skils&rsquo;kin employee is responsible for acting in an ethical, fair, and impartial manner in all interactions with our clients, individuals, community, and customers. It is the responsibility of each employee to respond promptly and positively to any concerns with our products or services. Each employee has the responsibility to promote Skils&rsquo;kin and protect its assets. Each employee has the responsibility to advocate for people with disabilities and promote public awareness of the rights and capabilities of people with disabilities.</p>
<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<ul>
<li>Know your customer - everyone has one.</li>
<li>Always clarify your understanding of a job ahead of time.</li>
<li>Check your own work more carefully than your supervisor.</li>
<li>Eagerly seek ways to improve your work, both in quality and quantity.</li>
<li>Show your belief in teamwork by showing up on time and ready to work, treating others with respect, working for the good of the team, cooperating with leaders, supporting each other, and being positive.&nbsp;</li>
