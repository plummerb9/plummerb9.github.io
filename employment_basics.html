<h1>Employment Basics</h1>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TPLd0i6VMF5YPxm5sro3ynS7Bp_YkBfrdG684K30Uaw3mL8G7inN_xe4gCQ8_9MQyTmNu2b9Or4NoUSS9ECQ=w1366-h662-rw" width="500" alt="A Skils'kin participant giving a speech">
<h2>Nature of Employment</h2>
<h3>Washington, Wyoming, North Dakota, and Oklahoma Employees</h3>
<p>Employment at Skils&rsquo;kin is &ldquo;at-will,&rdquo; which means that either the employee or Skils&rsquo;kin can end the employment relationship without cause and/or without notice at any time. This &ldquo;at-will&rdquo; relationship apples to all employees working in Washington, Wyoming, North Dakota, and Oklahoma.</p>
<h3>Montana Employees</h3>
<p>Employees working for Skils&rsquo;kin in Montana work on a probationary basis for one year from the date of hire. If an employee is absent for a significant period during the probationary period, the probationary period may be extended. The probationary period is used to determine if the employee performs satisfactorily and meets expectations of overall performance. During the probationary period, Skils&rsquo;kin may end the employment relationship at any time without cause and/or without notice.<br /> </p>
<h2>Equal Employment Opportunity</h2>
<p>Under its policy of Equal Employment Opportunity, Skils&rsquo;kin does not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, marital status, veteran status, creed, color, race, national origin, ancestry or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical disability, or family and/or caregiver responsibilities. This policy applies in all areas of Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s operation including recruitment, advertisement, purchasing, interviewing, hiring, promotions, transfers, demotions, upgrades, compensation, benefits, training and development, position elimination, terminations, return from layoffs, recreation programs, and all other privileges, terms, and conditions of employment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin adheres to all guidelines contained in the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, and all other applicable federal employment laws. Skils&rsquo;kin also adheres to applicable state employment laws, as appropriate depending upon the employee&rsquo;s work location. Skils&rsquo;kin currently employs people in Washington, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Complaints of discrimination or retaliation or any other employment-related matter must be reported, handled, and investigated pursuant to Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s Conflict Resolution Procedure. All complaints of discrimination or other similar claims will be investigated promptly and in as impartial and confidential a manner as possible. A timely resolution of each complaint should be reached and communicated to the parties involved. Skils&rsquo;kin prohibits any form of retaliation against employees for bringing bona fide complaints or providing information about discrimination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Employment Classifications</h2>
<p>The following are a few of the classifications that are used throughout this handbook. We provide this information so employees understand their employment status and eligibility for benefits. &nbsp;Classifications and benefit options are subject to change and do not constitute a guarantee of employment.</p>
<h3>Exemption Status</h3>
<p>Employees are either nonexempt or exempt from federal and state wage and hour laws. Employees will be informed of their exempt or nonexempt status upon hire. If you have further questions regarding your status, please contact your supervisor.</p>
<ol>
<li>Nonexempt employees are entitled to overtime compensation pursuant to certain provisions of federal and state law. Nonexempt employees are also covered by minimum wage and record keeping requirements.</li>
<li>Exempt employees are excluded from specific provisions of state and federal law requiring overtime pay, minimum wage, and record keeping. Exempt employees are paid on a salaried basis which is not based on hours worked.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Full-Time and Half-Time Employee Status</h3>
<ol>
<li>Full-Time Employee (SCA* and Non-SCA): An employee who is hired to work on a regular and predetermined schedule of at least 30 hours per week. Full-time employees are eligible for benefits once they satisfy the terms and conditions of the benefit programs.</li>
<li>Half-Time Employee (SCA and Non-SCA): An employee who is hired to work on a regular and predetermined schedule between 20 and 29 hours per week (eff.1/1/2015). A half-time employee may be eligible for prorated benefits.</li>
</ol>
<p>*SCA (Service Contract Act) employees are employees who are employed by Skils&rsquo;kin on a federal contract are subject to employment terms as stated in the U.S. Government Service Contract Act.</p>
<h3>Part-Time Employee</h3>
<p>An employee who is hired to work less than 19 hours per week.</p>
<h3>Temporary, Intern or Work Study Employees</h3>
<p>An employee who is hired on a temporary basis, usually with a determined regular work schedule in mind, with the expectation that he or she will be employed for a finite period of time.</p>
<h3>On-Call Employee</h3>
<p>An employee who is hired to work on an as-needed basis and without a regular work schedule in mind.</p>
<h2>Workweek</h2>
<p>For payroll and accounting purposes, the workweek begins at 12 a.m. on Sunday and ends at midnight the following Saturday. Business hours may differ among departments. Please check with your manager for the normal business hours in your department. Skils&rsquo;kin may establish workdays or workweeks for individual employees or certain positions.</p>
<h2>Scheduling</h2>
<p>It may be necessary to vary employees&rsquo; regular work hours/schedules from time to time. Additionally, employees may be required to work overtime or hours other than those normally. Punctual and consistent maintenance of standard attendance is a condition of employment.</p>
<p>Employees are expected to work all the hours and days assigned by their manager or supervisor. Employees are also expected to be at their workstations and ready to work at the beginning of their assigned shift. Employees are responsible for knowing their work schedule and ensuring they report to work as scheduled.</p>
<p>Nonexempt employees are not permitted to start working before they are scheduled to begin work or to work later than the end of the scheduled shift without prior written permission from the manager. &nbsp;To ensure that employees are ready to work as scheduled, employees may clock in 7 minutes before they are scheduled to begin work and must clock out no later than 7 minutes after the end of the work shift.</p>
<p>If an employee is scheduled to work and reports to work but is notified by their manager that no work is available, the employee will be sent home. Employees will only be compensated for hours worked, not for simply reporting to work. Work is paid in 15-minute increments at the regular pay rate. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Human Resources Director in writing. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Requesting Time Off</h3>
<p>Employees may request specific schedules or request time off from their manager. Schedule requests or time off requests must be made in advance and approved by the manager at the manager&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
<h3>Overtime</h3>
<p>Employees may not work over 40 hours in a work week without written authorization from the department manager. &nbsp;Employees are not permitted to work off the clock without being compensated. Employees who work overtime without the manager&rsquo;s written permission or work off the clock will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.</p>
<p>Non-exempt employees are paid an overtime rate of pay equal to one and one-half times the employee&rsquo;s regular rate of pay. The overtime rate is paid for all hours worked over 40 hours in a single workweek. Exempt employees are not paid overtime.</p>
<p>All complaints in any way relating to hours of work, payment of wages, overtime, and/or any other wage-related issue must be made to the Human Resource Director in writing. Employees are also required to follow the Conflict Resolution Procedure for all complaints.</p>
<h3>Rest and Meal Periods</h3>
<h4>Paid Rest Periods</h4>
<p>Nonexempt employees must receive one paid 10-minute rest period for every four hours worked and cannot be compelled to work more than three hours without a rest period. Rest periods should occur near the midpoint of each four-hour work period when possible. Managers or supervisors will schedule rest periods and communicate the schedule to employees. Paid rest periods may not be used to extend a lunch period, work overtime, or leave early.</p>
<h4>Meal Periods</h4>
<p>Nonexempt employees who work more than five consecutive hours in a day are required to take a meal period during the shift after two to five hours of working. Employees that work three or more hours beyond an eight-hour shift will be required to take an additional 30-minute unpaid meal period.</p>
<p>The normal meal period is an unpaid, 30-minute break. Employees are required to take the 30-minute meal period; however, an employee can choose to skip a meal period if they have their department manager&rsquo;s permission and they sign a waiver. Signing a waiver to skip a meal period is voluntary and cannot be mandated by management.</p>
<p>Personal activities such as smoking must occur <u>only</u> during authorized rest periods or meal periods.</p>
<p>Violation of the rest and meal period policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.</p>
<p>All complaints in any way relating to meal and rest periods must be made to the Human Resource Director in writing. Employees are also required to follow the Conflict Resolution Procedure for all complaints.</p>
<h3>Recordkeeping and Reporting</h3>
<p>All Skils&rsquo;kin employees must use their department&rsquo;s current timekeeping system to record hours worked. Methods of timekeeping may vary based on department and location. Employees are responsible for accurately recording time worked by clocking in and out using the current timekeeping system. If an employee fails to clock in or out properly, they must report the error to the manager who will correct the time record.</p>
<p>Time and attendance records are the property of Skils&rsquo;kin.&nbsp; Unauthorized alteration or falsification of any time record is prohibited and may subject the employee to discipline up to and including immediate termination of employment. No employee is permitted to clock in or out for another employee. Such action may subject any involved employee to discipline, up to and including immediate termination of employment. If an employee repeatedly has errors on their time record, they may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>
<h2>Compensation</h2>
<h3>Wage Determination</h3>
<p>Employees are assigned a rate of pay at the time of hire. The rate of pay is communicated at the time of new hire onboarding and each employee receives a letter outlining the employment offer.</p>
<p>Pay rates determinations are based on job duties, employee experience, the market for similar jobs, and any state or federal contract requirements. Wage increases are assessed and determined by the same factors and company budget considerations. Wage increases are granted at the sole discretion of Skils&rsquo;kin.</p>
<p>Exempt employees are not subject to salary deductions based on hourly quotas, absences of less than a full day, partial week absences caused by operating requirements, jury duty, attendance as a witness for less than a week, military service of only part of a week, or unpaid disciplinary suspensions that are not related to serious safety infractions and for less than a week.</p>
<h3>Payday and Payroll Deductions</h3>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin paydays are bi-weekly. A schedule of paydays can be provided to you by the Human Resource department at the time of hire.</p>
<p>Employees are paid every Friday following the close of a pay period (every other Friday). Pay is issued by direct deposit into the employee&rsquo;s bank account if elected or by a paper check.</p>
<p>Deductions are made from employees&rsquo; pay as required by state and federal requirements. Required deductions include FICA (Social Security and Medicare), federal income tax, and all other applicable state and federal taxes. Washington State employees also receive a deduction for a portion of the industrial insurance premium.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin will honor administrative and court orders for garnishment or wage withholding pursuant to state and federal law. Any other deductions may require written authorization from the employee.</p>
<p>Acceptance of your paycheck shall be verification that your hours worked, wages earned, and calculations are correct.</p>
<p>All complaints in any way relating to hours of work, payment of wages, overtime, and/or any other wage-related issue must be made to the Human Resource Director in writing. Employees are also required to follow the Conflict Resolution Procedure for all complaints.</p>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>Your personnel records are considered confidential company property. Although we are required to comply with subpoenas, court orders and government requests directing us to provide information from your personnel records without written authorization from you, only your job title and verification of employment dates will be released.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin shall determine if there is any irrelevant or erroneous information in the file and shall remove all such information. Skils&rsquo;kin is not prevented from removing information.</p>
<p>Requests for personal information shall comply with federal law regarding HIPAA (protection of personal health information) as well as other state and/or federal privacy laws.</p>
<h3>Change of Employee Information</h3>
<p>In the event of an emergency, Skils&rsquo;kin may need to know how to contact you or your nearest relatives. It is important to both the employee and the company that Skils&rsquo;kin has your most current physical and mailing address and telephone number at all times, as well as a current address and telephone number of the person(s) to be contacted in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>When you move, change your telephone number, or have other changes in your personal information, inform Human Resources of such changes so we can keep your personnel records accurate and up-to-date. It is your responsibility to be sure that the Human Resources department has your present physical and mailing address and phone number. If your marital status or dependents should change, you may have to change the number of exemptions claimed for income tax withholding purposes and add or delete members of your family on the respective insurance plans.</p>
<h3>Employee Access to Personnel Records</h3>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin will, at least annually, upon the request of an employee, permit the employee to inspect his or her own personnel file. An employee may petition Skils&rsquo;kin to review all information in the employee&rsquo;s personnel file that is regularly maintained by Skils&rsquo;kin as a part of its business records or subject to reference or information given to persons outside of Skils&rsquo;kin.</p>
<p>You may review your personnel records at a mutually convenient time during regular business hours, one time per year. If you wish to do so, please notify the Human Resources Department so a mutually agreed upon time may be scheduled. Any concerns regarding the completeness or accuracy of the information contained in your files should be taken up with your immediate supervisor and/or the Human Resources Department. If you disagree with an item in your file, you may appeal to management to have it corrected or removed. If your appeal is denied, you may place your own rebuttal or correction statement in the file.</p>
<h3>Legal Documents</h3>
<p>An employee of Skils&rsquo;kin who is served legal documents (i.e. subpeona) at work that pertains to the duties that particular employee performs on behalf of Skils&rsquo;kin should notify the Human Resources Department immediately for further direction.</p>
<h2>Disability Accommodation</h2>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin will make reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities, unless doing so will create an undue hardship on the organization. Before providing an accommodation, Skils&rsquo;kin will consider the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, the employer&rsquo;s financial resources, and the impact of the needed accommodation on the operation and on other employees and our customers.</p>
<p>An employee of Skils&rsquo;kin who feels he/she is in need of accommodation should communicate that need to his/her manager and Human Resources. Both HR and the manager will work with the employee to attempt to accommodate his/her needs through an interactive process between the employee and employer while fulfilling Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s work requirements, including the essential functions of the employee&rsquo;s job or duties.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin may ask the individual for reasonable documentation about his/her disability and functional limitations. All requests for accommodation are treated confidentially and will only be disclosed to those individuals within the organization who are necessary to the accommodation process.</p>
