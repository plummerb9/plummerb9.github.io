<h1>Safety and Security</h1>
<p>Security is an important concern for all employees. When leaving the premises at the end of your workday, check your work area for open windows, lights left on, running machinery, coffee makers and teapots left on, and other potential hazards.</p>
<h2>Unauthorized Personnel</h2>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin employees should make every effort to be aware of strangers on the premises. Anyone who notices an unfamiliar or unauthorized person on the premises should contact the supervisor in charge. Off-duty employees are not to be on the premises, other than public areas, except for official business or picking up paychecks on off-duty days. All visitors are required to check in at the front desk.</p>
<h2>Workplace violence</h2>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin strives to provide a safe workplace for all employees. To maintain a safe workplace and reduce the risk of violence, Skils&rsquo;kin has implemented a strong workplace policy and engages in ongoing supervisory and employee training in this area.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin does not tolerate any violence or threatened violence against any of our employees or visitors, including members of the public and/or family, friends, or acquaintances of an employee.</p>
<h3>Reporting Workplace violence</h3>
<p>Any employee in the workplace who has been subject to violence, witnessed violent behavior, or identified the warning signs of violence should immediately contact his or her program director or the Human Resources Director to report concerns. This report may be made orally or in writing regardless of the relationship between the reporting individual and any involved parties. Reports may be made anonymously. All reports will be promptly investigated and kept confidential to the extent possible.</p>
<h3>Consequences</h3>
<p>Any employee who makes threats, displays threatening behavior, commits violent acts, or carries out acts of harassment or stalking on Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s premises will be removed from the premises as quickly as safety permits. Such employees will also receive disciplinary action sufficient to eliminate any further prohibited activity, up to and including immediate termination of employment. These consequences will also apply to if employees use company resources, such as telephones, copiers, fax machines, computers, letterhead, social media, or vehicles, to carry out threats or harassment of any other person inside or outside this organization. If a non-employee commits an act prohibited by this policy, the non-employee will be removed from the premises as soon as safety permits and law enforcement will be immediately contacted. Skils&rsquo;kin may suspend or terminate any business relationship with the individual responsible for the prohibited conduct.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin will respond unacceptable behavior based on the needs of the affected employees and in a manner that protects all employees and eliminates the threat of similar acts in the future.</p>
<h3>Reporting Restraining Orders</h3>
<p>We require that all employees who obtain protective or restraining orders list the employer&rsquo;s location as a protected area and provide the Human Resources Director with a copy of the order granted, even if the order is temporary. We prefer to keep a certified copy of the order and will provide for the costs of certification.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Skils&rsquo;kin will work with the employee to fill out a trespasser information sheet so that others may identify the individual restrained. These steps will allow Skils&rsquo;kin to assist law enforcement and to create a safer workplace for the affected employee, his or her co-workers, and the public Skils&rsquo;kin serves. We understand the sensitivity of the information requested and all information will be treated with discretion.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin will release this information only to individuals or entities that need to know it. Failure to report a protective or restraining order may result in danger to co-workers and members of the public and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment.</p>
<h3>Leave</h3>
<p>If an employee needs time off to obtain an order of protection, seek medical treatment, or locate safe shelter, Skils&rsquo;kin may provide reasonable unpaid leave as needed. The employee may utilize available vacation or sick leave benefits during this time. Skils&rsquo;kin can also provide information regarding community resources in relation to intimate partner violence, harassment, and stalking. For discussion of these matters, please contact the Human Resources Director. (See also policy on Washington State Domestic Violence Leave.)</p>
<h3>Law Enforcement Assistance</h3>
<p>Many violent actions, such as assault, battery, and domestic/intimate partner violence, constitute criminal activities. In such cases, this organization will take all steps necessary to ensure that arrest and prosecution occurs.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Accident Reports</h2>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin requires that you promote safety and prevent injuries to yourself and other employees, customers, and visitors by observing all applicable state and federal regulations and all company rules. Please refer to our separate safety materials, such as our safety manual and accident prevention program, for more specific information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Promptly report all unsafe or potentially hazardous conditions to your supervisor.</li>
<li>Learn the posted fire rules, the location of fire alarm boxes, fire extinguishers, escape routes, and your own duties in case of fire.</li>
<li>Keep individual work areas clean and orderly.</li>
<li>Do not operate electrical equipment with wet hands.</li>
<li>Store all materials and equipment in their proper areas.</li>
<li>If your job requires protective clothing or equipment, always use it as required.</li>
<li>Do not engage in horseplay.</li>
<li>Drive safely and courteously when operating vehicles.</li>
<li>Do not smoke or permit others to smoke in Skils&rsquo;kin facilities or company vehicles. Smoking on Skils&rsquo;kin property is permitted only in smoking-designated areas.</li>
<li>When lifting heavy objects, follow the proper procedures and use the appropriate number of persons to assist you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Safety Orientation and Training</h3>
<p>We also provide specialized safety orientation and training for certain jobs. Attendance is mandatory so that you will be familiar with all safety rules and procedures that are unique to your job and work area.</p>
<h3>Accidents</h3>
<p>If you should sustain an injury while on the job, you are required to notify the nearest available supervisor immediately. The supervisor will arrange any appropriate first aid and/or arrange for transportation to obtain appropriate medical attention if necessary. Late reporting of an injury while on the job may be cause for discipline up to and including termination.</p></article>
