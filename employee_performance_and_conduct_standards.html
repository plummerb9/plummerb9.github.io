<h1>Employee Performance and Conduct Standards</h1>
<h2>Performance Reviews</h2>
<p>Ongoing performance reviews provide you and your supervisor the opportunity to discuss how well you are meeting Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s expectations and how to improve performance. Your performance review is part of your personnel records. You are asked to sign your performance review to indicate that it was reviewed with you. However, your signature does not necessarily imply agreement with the evaluation.</p>
<p>We may conduct performance reviews at the anniversary date of employment and each anniversary date thereafter. Temporary employees do not receive formal performance reviews, although their performance may be monitored. Performance reviews may also be conducted at other times for specific reasons such as promotion, poor work performance, or disciplinary problems.</p>
<p>A leave of absence of 30 days or more may result in your performance review being postponed until you have returned to work and have completed continuous employment equal to the length of the leave of absence.</p>
<h2>Attendance and Tardiness</h2>
<p>Regular attendance and punctuality are essential functions of any position with Skils&rsquo;kin. You must report to work regularly and on time. If you will be unable to report to work or will be late, you must let your supervisor know as soon as you know you will be absent or tardy and always before your scheduled starting time.</p>
<p>If you must leave a message at any of our locations, be sure to state (1) your reason for being late or for not being able to report to work, (2) the probable duration of your absence, and (3) a telephone number where you can be reached. If your absence or tardiness is due to an emergency, you must call in or have someone call in for you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Attendance or tardiness problems as well as failure to call in may result in discipline, up to and including immediate termination of employment. Any employee who fails to report for work or fails to call in for 3 consecutive workdays will be deemed to have voluntarily terminated employment.</p>
<p>Excessive absences or tardiness (more than 3 in 6 months), even for legitimate reasons, may be cause for discipline, up to and including immediate termination of employment.</p>
<h2>Personal Appearance</h2>
<p>Public perceptions about Skils&rsquo;kin can help us succeed and prosper or contribute to a loss of business. Perceptions are formed, fairly or not, partly by the outward appearance and dress of our employees. A neat and clean personal appearance is essential to our public perception and your own advancement.</p>
<p>You should wear clothing appropriate for each job. Contact your supervisor for specific dress standards for your area.</p>
<p>Employees who are inappropriately dressed may be sent home without pay and directed to return to work in proper attire.</p>
<h2>Standards of Conduct and Discipline</h2>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin is involved in a highly competitive business in which many individuals and companies rely on the quality and reliability of our services. Thus, all employees are expected to provide excellent and reliable performance. Any failure to meet this high standard is grounds for concern or discipline, up to and including immediate termination of employment.</p>
<p>By way of example and not limitation, the following conduct is strictly prohibited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failure or refusal to carry out legitimate job assignments and management requests (insubordination);</li>
<li>Unauthorized release of private employer information;</li>
<li>Swearing or verbal abuse while on our premises;</li>
<li>Falsification of any work, personnel or other records;</li>
<li>Removal of property without permission;</li>
<li>Unauthorized taking of funds or property or unauthorized charges against an account;</li>

<li>Fraternization between staff and client or supervisor and subordinate;</li>
<li>Participation in a business directly competing with Skils&rsquo;kin;</li>
<li>Carrying firearms;</li>
<li>Carrying unauthorized passengers;</li>
<li>Serious misconduct of any kind;</li>
<li>Inefficient, substandard, careless or negligent performance of an assigned duty or responsibility; or in the care or use of Skils&rsquo;kin property;</li>
<li>Excessive absenteeism or tardiness in reporting to work or returning from rest periods or meal periods;</li>
<li>Failure to report an absence in accordance with the absenteeism policy;</li>
<li>Failure to comply with safety or security rules and procedures;</li>
<li>Sleeping on the job; and/or</li>
<li>Violation of any policy or procedure contained herein.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Harassment</h2>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin is committed to providing a work environment where all employees are treated with respect and dignity. Therefore, Skils&rsquo;kin expressly prohibits any form of unlawful employee harassment based on race, color, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, veteran or marital status, physical or mental disabilities, family and/or caregiver responsibilities or status in any other legally protected group. Harassment may have serious consequences not only for the employees involved, but also for the entire organization. Therefore, it is the responsibility of all employees to cooperate with, and assist in the implementation of, this policy.</p>
<p>It is both illegal and against company policy for any employee, male or female, to harass another employee. By the term &ldquo;harassment&rdquo; Skils&rsquo;kin means unwelcome, annoying or offensive conduct directed at another employee such as threats, demands, requests, pursuit, teasing, abuse, taunts, insults, heckling, torment, or other similar action.</p>
<p>Each manager is responsible for creating and maintaining an atmosphere free of harassment, sexual or otherwise. Furthermore, all employees are responsible for respecting the rights of their co-workers, employees, clients, or visitors of Skils&rsquo;kin and strictly adhering to the letter and spirit of this policy.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin will not condone, under any circumstances, illegal harassment, including sexual harassment, by any member of its management team or any other employee, client, visitor, volunteer, or guest. Even conduct that is intended to be &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; may still constitute illegal harassment if it falls within the terms of this policy. If a co-worker, client, visitor, volunteer, or guest, or any member of management expresses concern that your behavior may have violated this policy, please respect his or her concern. Regardless of your intent, how others interpret your behavior is important.</p>
<p>This policy is not meant to interfere with or discourage friendships among employees. However, employees must be sensitive to acts or conduct which may be considered offensive by other employees and refrain from engaging in such conduct. Any employee who violates this policy may be subject to discipline up to and including termination.</p>
<p>The provision of detailed information in the policy set forth below relating to &ldquo;sexual harassment&rdquo; or &ldquo;disability harassment&rdquo; should not be interpreted as a lessened commitment to the prevention of other types of possible unlawful harassment. No type of unlawful harassment is acceptable.</p>
<h3>Sexual Harassment</h3>
<p>It is both illegal and against policy for any employee, male or female, to harass another employee, client, or visitor of Skils&rsquo;kin based on his or her gender. For purposes of this policy, sexual harassment refers to (1) unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and all other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, and (2) comments, jokes, innuendoes, and other sexually oriented statements, where with respect to any of the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment; or</li>
<li>Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for decisions affecting an individual&rsquo;s employment; or</li>
<li>Such conduct has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of the type of conduct which are likely to violate this policy include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexually suggestive touching, such as rubbing or massaging someone&rsquo;s neck or shoulders, stroking someone&rsquo;s hair, or intentionally brushing against another&rsquo;s body.</li>
<li>Grabbing, groping, kissing, or fondling another person, either male or female.</li>
<li>Lewd, off-color, sexually-oriented comments or jokes.</li>
<li>Sexually suggestive leering or stalking.</li>
<li>Suggestive or sexually explicit posters, calendars, photographs, graffiti, or cartoons which have the effect of creating a hostile and offensive workplace.</li>
<li>Sexually explicit or suggestive e-mail or voice mail messages.</li>
<li>Sexually oriented or explicit remarks, including written or oral references to sexual conduct, gossip regarding one&rsquo;s sex life, body, sexual activities, deficiencies, or prowess.</li>
<li>Questions about one&rsquo;s sex life or experiences.</li>
<li>Sexual favors in return for employment rewards, or threats if sexual favors are not provided.</li>
<li>Sexual assault or rape.</li>
<li>Any other sexually harassing conduct or behavior deemed inappropriate by Skils&rsquo;kin.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disability Harassment</h3>
<p>Disability harassment is a form of discriminatory conduct in which the respect and dignity given people of disability is less than that generally given to others. Disability harassment includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jokes;</li>
<li>Slurs or derogatory remarks;</li>
<li>Graffiti or gestures;</li>
<li>Unwelcome staring;</li>
<li>Unnecessary questions about the individual&rsquo;s disability; and</li>
<li>Conduct intended to interfere with the individual&rsquo;s work performance or create a hostile, intimidating, or offensive work environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prohibition of Retaliation</h3>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin prohibits any form of retaliation against any employee for good faith actions in filing a harassment complaint, reporting suspected harassment, or assisting in a complaint investigation. Improper retaliation may include, but is not limited to, treating the employee who has made a complaint of harassment in a non-professional manner, questioning the complaining employee or witnesses about their involvement in an investigation, or otherwise taking retaliatory or negative action against the employee. If you believe that you have been subjected to retaliation for making a complaint of harassment, or if you observe that another employee has been subjected to such retaliation, you are expected to report the matter immediately by using the Complaint Procedure described below.</p>
<h3>Harassment Retaliation Complaint Procedure</h3>
<p>If you believe that Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s policies on harassment have been violated, you may bring a complaint by contacting any manager.</p>
<p>All employees should feel free to make a complaint or discuss this policy with a manager if they feel they may have been wrongfully harassed or if they have questions relating to the issue of harassment. Keep in mind, however, that as a member of management, your manager is obligated to provide this information to Human Resources.</p>
<p>In general, if you feel that you have experienced any job-related harassment based on your race, color, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, veteran or marital status, physical or mental disabilities, family and/or caregiver responsibilities or status in any other legally protected group, you should contact your manager or Human Resources.</p>
<h2>Drug Free Workplace Policy</h2>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for our employees. This includes a ban on the use of alcohol and illegal drugs at work. Alcohol and illegal drugs are also banned from being present in any of Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s work locations. This notice summarizes modifications to Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s Drug and Alcohol-Free Workplace and Drug Testing policy.</p>
<p>We strive for and value a company culture that holds every employee accountable for workplace safety and satisfactory work performance. Skils&rsquo;kin wants to ensure that employees have adequate resources and knowledge about the impact of substance abuse on the work place and on their personal lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Employees who have jobs that are regulated by state and federal requirements, may have additional requirements to include additional drug testing requirements.</p>
<h3>Prohibited Activities</h3>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin employees are prohibited from the following activities and behaviors while at work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consuming alcoholic beverages or using drugs, other than for medical reasons during work hours or breaks, whether on or off company property.</li>
<li>Possession, selling, manufacture, or distribution of alcohol or illegal drugs while working and/or on company property.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an employee, it is expected that you report to work in suitable condition to satisfactorily and safely perform the duties of your job. This also means that you must follow Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s Drug and Alcohol-Free Workplace policy and to demonstrate a reasonable attitude towards the use of alcohol and drugs.</p>
<p>The definition of illegal drug is defined as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>An illegal substance, including but not limited to, narcotics, hallucinogens, cocaine, marijuana, and designer drugs.</li>
<li>A controlled substance, including but not limited to amphetamines and barbiturates that are used without being prescribed or are used in excess of the amount prescribed by a licensed physician.</li>
</ol>
<p>The term of &ldquo;unfit condition&rdquo; is based on the following examples of behaviors by an employee that demonstrate the inability to perform their job satisfactorily or safely. This list of examples is not inclusive of all possible behaviors that may be indicators of impairment due to drug or alcohol use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drowsiness</li>
<li>Sleepiness or sleeping</li>
<li>Slurred or incoherent speech</li>
<li>Aggressive actions toward people or objects</li>
<li>Unusually depressive</li>
<li>Unusual or rapid mood changes</li>
<li>Disorientation or inability to concentrate</li>
<li>Lack of coordination walking or performing tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reporting Convictions</h3>
<p>Employees are required to notify their manager or Human Resources within five (5) calendar days when they have been convicted of a drug related crime in the workplace. Skils&rsquo;kin is a federal contractor and complies with contracting requirements to maintain a drug free workplace program.</p>
<h3>Consequences for Non-Compliance</h3>
<p>Employees who violate Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s Drug Free Workplace policy will be subject to disciplinary actions, including separation of employment.</p>
<h3>Prevention</h3>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin will assist employees to seek treatment related to substance abuse and will provide access to a confidential Employee Assistance Program or other community resources. Skils&rsquo;kin will provide employees with periodic educational resources to assist them with understanding the effects of alcohol and drug abuse and how to seek treatment.</p>
<p>Employees should contact Human Resources or their manager for information about the Employee Assistance Program or to request additional resources for substance abuse treatment or prevention.</p>
<p>We encourage employees who feel they may have substance abuse problem to seek treatment and request a leave of absence if needed. The length of the leave, if approved, will be determined based on the specific needs and circumstances of the employee&rsquo;s job status.</p>
<h3>Drug Testing</h3>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin expects its employees to perform their job in a safe and responsible manner. If there is a reason to suspect that an employee is working while under the influence of an illegal drug or alcohol, the employee will be required to submit to a drug test and/or alcohol test.</p>
<p>Testing may be done onsite, or the employee may be sent to a certified lab for testing. Employees thought to be working under the influence will be suspended until results of the tests are confirmed. Testing positive will result in separation of employment.</p>
<p>Employees will be tested after an accident/incident or under the conditions of reasonable suspicion.</p>
<h3>Post-Accident/Incident Testing</h3>
<p>Employees will be tested when they have been found to cause an accident or a near-miss safety incident. If injured, employees will be tested after receiving appropriate medical treatment.</p>
<h3>Reasonable Suspicion Testing</h3>
<p>Employees will be tested when there is reasonable suspicion of being under the influence of a prohibited drug or alcohol. Testing for reasonable suspicion is based on specific observations by a trained supervisor(s), concerning the employee&rsquo;s appearance, behavior, body odors, or speech.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin will modify its drug testing requirements when necessary to ensure a drug and alcohol-free workplace.</p>
<p>Employees may address questions about this policy to their manager or one of the following Human Resource staff.</p></article>
