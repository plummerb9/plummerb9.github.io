<h1>Conflict Resolution</h1>
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/166060913@N02/43774143331/in/dateposted-public/" title="conflict-resolution.jpg"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1814/43774143331_7d2850fc05.jpg" width="500" height="289" alt="A Skils'kin employee talking to a food service worker in a kitchen"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>If you have a complaint or need a problem solved, we encourage you to bring it up as soon as possible with those who can solve it. Skils&rsquo;kin prohibits any form of retaliation against any employee for good faith actions in filing a complaint under this policy.</p>
<p>Most concerns about safety, wages, hours, supervision, discipline, and application of policy or other working conditions can be solved by talking with your immediate supervisor. However, if you believe a work condition or treatment is unjust, inequitable, a hindrance to effective operation, or creates a problem, you should initially direct your concerns with whom your complaint exists. Please note, however, that if an employee feels a violation of our General Prohibition against Harassment (or related policies) they should contact their manager or Human Resources. Employees are not expected or required to confront the alleged harasser as part of the complaint process.</p>
<p>To be responsive to our employees and their concerns, Skils&rsquo;kin utilizes both formal and informal conflict resolution procedures that have been designed for the benefit and use of employees, supervisors, and management to assist in resolving workplace conflicts.</p>
<h3>Step One &mdash; Informal Procedure</h3>
<ol>
<li>The employee&rsquo;s supervisor should be the first source of assistance. If the complaint is with the employee&rsquo;s supervisor, the employee should schedule an appointment with the next level supervisor to discuss the problem giving rise to the complaint within five (5) working days in which the incident occurred</li>
<li>The immediate supervisor should respond to the informal complaint within five (5) days of the meeting held with the complainant employee.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step Two &mdash; Formal Procedure</h3>
<h4>Written Complaint</h4>
<p>If the informal procedure does not resolve the problem to the mutual satisfaction of the employee and the supervisor, or if the supervisor does not respond to the complaint, the employee may submit a written complaint. The submission of the written complaint is due within five (5) working days of the response (or lack of response) from the supervisor and must include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The problem and the date when the incident occurred.</li>
<li>Verbal or written response from immediate supervisor, if provided, and the date when the employee met with their immediate supervisor.</li>
<li>Suggestions on ways to resolve the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Human Resources can assist employees who would like help writing their complaints. Complaints must be submitted to the employee&rsquo;s department manager and a copy should be forwarded to Human Resources.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the formal complaint, the department manager should schedule a meeting with the employee within five (5) working days to discuss the complaint.</p>
<p>Within approximately five (5) working days after the discussion, the director/department head should issue a decision both in writing and orally to the employee filing the complaint.</p>
<h4>Appeals to Human Resources</h4>
<p>If the employee is dissatisfied with the decision of the department manager, the employee may, within five (5) working days, appeal this decision in writing to the Human Resources Department to investigate the complaint.</p>
<p>Human Resources may call a meeting with the parties directly involved to facilitate a resolution. Human Resources may also refer complaints to a review committee if he/she is of the opinion that the complaint raises serious questions of fact or interpretation of policy. Human Resources may gather further information from involved parties. All involved individuals, other than Human Resources, will be charged with the responsibility of not discussing the situation with any other employee or with the complainant employee.</p>
<h4>Appeals to CEO and the Board of Directors</h4>
<p>If the employee is dissatisfied with the decision of the Human Resources Department, the employee may, within five (5) working days, appeal this decision in writing to the CEO to investigate the complaint. The decision of the CEO should be final. In the event the HR Director is the subject of the grievance, the employee may inform the CEO directly or through their manager. In the event the CEO is subject of the grievance, The Board of Directors should be notified through the Board President.</p>
<h4>Appeals to Board Personnel Committee</h4>
<p>If the employee is not satisfied with the decision and wishes to pursue the matter further, he/she may prepare a written summary of the concerns and request that the matter be reviewed by the Board Personnel Committee that is appointed ad hoc by the Board President. &nbsp;This request should be made through the Human Resources Director who will notify the CEO and the Personnel Committee Chairperson. The Committee, after a full review of the facts (which may include a review of the written summary of the problem, interviews with the people involved, and further investigation if necessary) will inform him/her of its decision usually within 30 working days. The decision of the Committee should be final.</p>
<h3>Employee Responsibility for Conflict Resolution Procedure Appeals</h3>
<p>If an employee fails to appeal from one level to the next level of the Conflict Resolution procedure within the time limits established in the procedure, the problem should be considered settled on the basis of the last decision and the problem submitted by the employee should not be subject for further consideration.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin reserves the right to impose appropriate disciplinary action for any conduct it considers to be disruptive or inappropriate or a violation of its policies and procedures contained herein or a violation of either state or federal law.</p></article>
