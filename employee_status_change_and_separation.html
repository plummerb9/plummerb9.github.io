<h1>Employee Status Change and Separation</h1>
<h2>Transfers and Promotions</h2>
<p>Our goal is to hire the most qualified candidate when filling vacancies or new positions within Skils&rsquo;kin. During the selection process, preference may be given to a current employee if all other factors are relatively equal. However, because of legal requirements, levels of education, and other qualifications required for some positions, promotions from within our organization are not always possible. Past performance, qualifications, abilities, job experience, and potential are important factors that we consider in the selection process of employees for promotion.</p>
<p>We post open position notices on bulletin boards except for certain top management positions. Management reserves the right to determine relative qualifications for a posted position or to hire from outside Skils&rsquo;kin rather than promote from within. Pending transfers must be communicated to each manager who is affected.</p>
<p>Transfers may be initiated at any time by Skils&rsquo;kin. This allows us to broaden the range of skills within the organization, meet identified needs, and enhance employee versatility.</p>
<h2>Separation</h2>
<p>Except for Montana employees, it is understood that the employment relationship is at will and can be terminated at any time without notice or just cause by either party. No employee, manager, or supervisor has the right to change this relationship or to make a contract binding on the company except the CEO.</p>
<p>Employees who have resigned their employment with proper notice or were laid off are eligible for rehire based on the same terms and conditions as other applicants.</p>
<h3>Voluntary Resignation</h3>
<p>If you voluntarily terminate your employment, we require that non-supervisory employees give at least two weeks&rsquo; notice to your supervisor (management employees are expected to provide at least four weeks&rsquo; written notice), stating the reason for the resignation. An employee that resigns from their position and does not provide proper notice risks having his or her employment status with Skils&rsquo;kin be considered as &ldquo;ineligible for rehire status.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Layoffs</h3>
<p>There are certain times when it may become necessary to lay off employees because of changing business conditions. If Skils&rsquo;kin determines that a reduction in force becomes necessary or appropriate, we will make every reasonable effort to give you at least a two-week notice. Layoffs within each classification may be based on length of service with Skils&rsquo;kin.</p>
<p>All layoffs are considered permanent. Laid-off employees are entitled to reemployment according to the provisions on rehiring former employees. Any employee recalled from layoff must return to work within five working days when offered reemployment.</p>
<h2>Exit Interviews</h2>
<p>The Human Resources Department or a designee may try to conduct an exit interview with terminated employees. The purposes for this interview include ensuring the return of all Skils&rsquo;kin property; reviewing financial issues and accrued vacation; discussing reasons for the termination, layoff or resignation; and obtaining the employee&rsquo;s input and suggestions for improvement. You will be informed of any rights to continued benefits coverage at this time. Unless other arrangements have been made for earlier payment, your final paycheck will be available on the payday of the pay period during which your employment terminated. Wyoming employees&rsquo; final payment is made within five (5) days of their termination date.</p></article>
