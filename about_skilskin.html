<p>Skils&rsquo;kin is a community-based, nonprofit organization that provides employment and representative payee services to adults with disabilities, helping them grow and thrive within the community. Through these collaborative services, Skils&rsquo;kin helps individuals with disabilities find meaningful employment and effectively manage their financial resources, promoting integration and, ultimately, a top quality of life in the process.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin directly employs individuals with and without disabilities to provide products and services for businesses and the government through the its Commercial Services department and its AbilityOne contracts in Washington, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, and Oklahoma. Skils&rsquo;kin also places individuals with disabilities in jobs in the community through its comprehensive Employment Services department. In addition to these employment services, Skils&rsquo;kin also provides representative payee services through its Payee Services department.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1970, concerned parents, family members and business leaders in Spokane organized the Pre-Vocational Training Center to provide services to Spokane-area adults with developmental, physical and mental disabilities. In 2004, the company name was changed to Skils&rsquo;kin, a Native American word that means &ldquo;a place where a person goes to seek personal identity and self-empowerment.&rdquo; Working with national and local businesses and organizations, we are able to assist people with a wide variety of disabilities to become more self-reliant and economically self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin has also been active in the AbilityOne program since 1978. The AbilityOne program is a federal program that creates jobs and training opportunities for people who are blind or who have other disabilities, empowering them to lead more productive and independent lives. Through this AbilityOne program, Skils&rsquo;kin currently provides employment opportunities to individuals with disabilities in food services, custodial services, and grounds maintenance.</p>
<p>Through our continuing commitment to work together with our many friends and business partners in the community, we are able to assist people with a wide variety of disabilities to become more self-reliant and economically self-sufficient. Each person, regardless of his or her abilities, is an individual capable of growing, learning, and developing. The services and supports we offer are designed to maximize this potential and to increase independence and full inclusion into the community.</p>
