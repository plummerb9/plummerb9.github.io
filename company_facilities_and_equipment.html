<h2>Parking</h2>
<p>General parking is on a first-come, first-serve basis. A number of handicapped parking spaces are reserved for Skils&rsquo;kin employees/visitors who have authorized tags. You are requested to park only in the spaces provided for employees to ensure ample parking for visitors. We do not assume responsibility for vehicles or their contents in any parking area, regardless of location.</p>
<h2>Use of Telephones</h2>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin telephone lines are intended solely for business use and should not be used for personal phone calls. No personal long distance or toll calls are to be charged to Skils&rsquo;kin. Personal use of your cellular phones should be during break and meal periods. Personal cell phone use should be kept to a minimum during work hours.</p>
<h2>Property Issue</h2>
<p>During your employment with Skils&rsquo;kin, you may be issued a variety of items, such as clothing, keys, cell phones, laptops, software, etc. You will be expected to sign a &lsquo;Property Issuance&rsquo; form that will list these items and their monetary replacement value. Should you lose or not return any of these items, you may be responsible for reimbursing Skils&rsquo;kin in the amount of the monetary replacement value, as permitted by state and federal law.</p>
<h2>Searches and Inspections</h2>
<p>To ensure security, Skils&rsquo;kin reserves the right to conduct searches of company property, including workstations, desks, file cabinets, lockers and similar areas. This also extends to computers (e-mail and internet), cell phones, and telephones (voice messages). The company may search company areas at any time, either randomly or when there is a reason to believe that prohibited items may be present.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin reserves the right to conduct searches of your personal possessions, including lunchboxes, briefcases, backpacks, packages or other items carried onto company property. Visual inspections of vehicles may be performed from outside (i.e. looking through the windows). Please be advised that you have no reasonable expectation of privacy or confidentiality as it relates to company property and your personal possessions.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin reserves the right to deny entrance to any employee who refuses to cooperate with a request to search personal possessions. Employees who refuse to cooperate may be subject to discipline, up to and including immediate discharge from employment.</p>
<p>Any search will be conducted in compliance with all federal, state, local or other laws. Anyone who feels they have been mistreated should report their concerns immediately to their supervisor or Corporate Compliance.</p>
<h2>IT Policies</h2>
<p>Each employee must read the Skils&rsquo;kin network security policies and sign a statement indicating they have read, understand, and agree to comply with these policies. A copy of this acknowledgement statement will be kept in their personnel file. The employee&rsquo;s signature must be witnessed, and the employee will be given a written copy.</p>
<p>All network security policies can be read in their entirety on the company network.</p>
<p>Violation of these policies or divulging confidential information may lead to immediate termination.</p>
