<h2>Group Insurance Programs</h2>
<p>You may be eligible to participate in certain insurance programs. Programs vary according to your job classification. We will explain your benefits options during your orientation training. If your classification changes, you should discuss the possible impact on your insurance program availability with the Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s benefits coordinator. Any questions that you have regarding group insurance plans should be addressed to the benefits coordinator. Skils&rsquo;kin intends to continue the programs indefinitely but reserves the right to change or discontinue these plans at any time. Participants will be notified of any changes. Participants will receive instruction on converting group insurance to individual policies whenever conversion privileges apply. Please remember that the actual benefits provided and eligibility requirements are determined by the plan documents.</p>
<h3>ACA</h3>
<p>The federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that all individuals must have health coverage as of 1/1/2014. Questions regarding compliance with this law may be addressed to the Benefits Coordinator.</p>
<h3>COBRA</h3>
<p>Federal law requires us to allow employees to continue on the medical plan for 18 months following voluntary or involuntary termination of employment for reasons other than gross misconduct and allow spouses or dependents to continue coverage for up to 36 months following a divorce or legal separation of the covered employee.</p>

<p>If any holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, Skils&rsquo;kin will determine whether the observed holiday will be on Friday or Monday. For employees working under the Service Contract Act, the requirements of the coordinating body (i.e. Federal or Department of Defense) will be followed.</p>
<p>SCA employees are paid for the holiday if they are in a pay status during the week of the holiday per the SCA regulations.</p>
<p>For non-SCA employees, holiday pay will not be paid out if you are on any type of unpaid leave before or after any of the above listed holidays. Part time, temporary and on-call workers are not eligible for holiday pay. Full time employees receive 8 hours of holiday and half-time employees receive 4 hours of holiday pay, regardless of scheduled hours for that holiday.</p>
<h2>Vacation</h2>
<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<p>For non-SCA employees, vacation begins accruing on the employee&rsquo;s first day of work; however, vacation benefits cannot be used during the first three months of employment. Vacation hours stop accruing at the beginning of the pay period in which the termination occurs. Vacation hours must be accrued to be used (no advanced leave). Vacation leave is not accrued during non-work periods, such as unpaid leaves of absence. Employees working under the Federal Service Contract Act are paid vacation in accordance with the terms, conditions, and requirements of the contract.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Vacation</h3>
<p>Vacation leave must be approved and scheduled by the employee&rsquo;s supervisor and depends upon the work load. When possible, your leave will be scheduled at the time requested by you; however, management&rsquo;s need to ensure proper service and production coverage will prevail. Leave requests made ahead of time are more likely to be honored.</p>
<p>If a conflict occurs between two employees in scheduling annual leave, the employee who requested the time off first or is most senior may take preference so long as management determines that proper service and production levels can be met. For exempt employees, the minimum amount of annual leave that will be scheduled is one (1) day. <strong>Vacation leave is important to each employee&rsquo;s rest and relaxation</strong>. Each employee is strongly encouraged to utilize their accrued vacation during the course of each year. Further questions regarding the usage of vacation should be directed to your manager or the Human Resources Department.</p>

<p>*Days are assumed on an eight-hour day.</p>
<p>Employees under the SCA contract that work half-time or less, including seasonal workers, accrue vacation based on a formula set in the SCA contract. Please contact your supervisor for more information.</p>
<h3>Benefit Accumulation</h3>
<p>The maximum amount of vacation leave that can be accumulated is 6 weeks (240 hours) for full-time employees and 3 weeks (120 hours) for half-time employees. Additional leave accruals will cease until the balance decreases below the accrual maximum. It is the employee&rsquo;s responsibility to monitor his/her leave balance.</p>
<h3>Payment upon Termination</h3>
<p>After completion of one full year of employment, upon termination, full time non-SCA employees will be paid for vacation balances not to exceed 80 hours. Half-time non-SCA employees will be paid for balances not to exceed 40 hours after completion of one full year of employment. SCA employees will be paid out their earned vacation hour balance upon termination.</p>
<h2>Leave</h2>
<h3>Sick Leave</h3>
<p>Employees working under the Federal Service Contract Act do not have sick leave per their contracts. The statements below only apply to non-SCA employees.</p>
<p>If you miss work because of an illness or other valid reason, you may be allowed to take sick leave to cover payment for lost work hours and to care for sick family members. If you have no sick leave hours available, vacation hours may be used. Absence due to illness may require written confirmation by a doctor&rsquo;s certificate at the time you return to work or earlier at the discretion of Skils&rsquo;kin. Your accumulated reserve of earned leave may be used for the following situations only:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal illness; or</li>
<li>Personal temporary medical disability (e.g. associated with pregnancy or childbirth); or</li>
<li>Health condition of a child under the age of 18 that requires treatment or supervision; or</li>
<li>Adult children incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental disability; or</li>
<li>Serious health or emergency condition of a spouse, domestic partner, parent, parent-in-law, or grandparent; or</li>
<li>Approved Family Medical Leave.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sick leave is accumulated on the employee&rsquo;s start date. Full-time employees accrue sick leave benefits at the rate of 1.85 hours per pay period. Half-time employees accrue sick leave benefits at the rate of .92 hours per pay period.&nbsp; Employees do not accrue sick leave benefits during non-work time such as unpaid leave of absence. Unused sick leave hours are carried over from year to year. Unused sick leave benefits are not paid out upon termination of employment.</p>
<p>Any employee deemed to have abused sick leave privileges by falsification, misrepresentation, or excessive use may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including immediate termination.</p>
<h3>Bereavement Leave</h3>
<p>In case of a death in your immediate family, you may receive up to three scheduled shifts paid leave, during a calendar year. In the event of the death of a member of your immediate family that is more than 500 miles from the workplace, you may take extra days as needed, using your vacation or sick time as appropriate. This time off is intended to be used to attend memorial services as well as to attend to associated family matters. Immediate family includes your spouse, domestic partner, children, step-children, siblings, parents, aunts, uncles, parents-in-law, grandparents or grandchildren. This does not apply to on-call or temporary employees.</p>
<h3>Family or Medical Leave</h3>
<p>FMLA requires covered employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job protected leave in a 12-month period to &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; employees for certain family and/or medical reasons, in most qualifying situations, and 26 weeks in a 12-month period to &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; employees for caregiver leave for an injured service member. As provided by the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the 2008 Amendment to the FMLA, employers with at least 50 employees will be covered by the terms of the FMLA. An employee will be covered where he or she is employed in a location with at least fifty (50) employees with-in seventy-five (75) miles; he or she has worked at least 1,250 hours in the past twelve (12) months of employment; and has worked for the employer for at least twelve months, not necessarily consecutive.</p>
<p>Employees can use FMLA leave for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the birth of a son or daughter or to care for and bond with a newborn child;</li>
<li>For placement of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care and to care for and bond with the child after placement;</li>
<li>To care for the employee&rsquo;s spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition;</li>
<li>To care for an adult child with a disability;</li>
<li>Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee&rsquo;s job;</li>
<li>To care for the employee&rsquo;s spouse, son, daughter, parent, or nearest blood relative who is a member of the Armed Forces and who suffers injury or illness while on active duty; and</li>
<li>Because of a &ldquo;qualified exigency&rdquo; that required the employee to take leave due to a spouse, son, daughter, or parent being on active duty or having been notified of an impending call or order to active duty in the Armed Forces.</li>
</ul>
<p>A &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave is the method Skils&rsquo;kin uses for calculating leave eligibility. Employees will receive 60 days written notice of any change in the method for calculating leave eligibility. If the employee has accrued paid leave, e.g., vacation, sick, or PTO leave, the employee must use paid leave first and take the remainder of the 12 weeks, if any, as unpaid leave.</p>
<p>FMLA leave may begin before the actual date of the birth of a child. An expectant mother may take FMLA leave pursuant to the Pregnancy Disability Leave Section before the birth of the child for prenatal care or if her condition makes her unable to work. A pregnant employee may take leave intermittently for prenatal examinations or for her own condition, such as for periods of severe morning sickness. Likewise, leave may be taken prior to the actual date of placement for adoption or foster care to attend to the necessary details of completing the placement. Washington&rsquo;s State Family Leave laws provide greater and additional rights to leave for pregnant employees beyond the 12 weeks of leave provided under FMLA.</p>
<p>FMLA is available on the same terms for men and women. Such leave may be taken, where appropriate, in a lump sum amount, on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule for the birth or adoption of a child or placement of a foster child with prior approval from Skils&rsquo;kin, or on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule to care for a family member with a serious health condition upon a doctor&rsquo;s certification of medical necessity. Employees needing intermittent FMLA leave or a reduced leave schedule must attempt to schedule their leave so as to not disrupt Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s operations. Additionally, where the need for intermittent leave is planned, Skils&rsquo;kin may assign the employee to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits that better accommodates the employee&rsquo;s intermittent or reduced leave schedule.</p>
<p>Where husband and wife are employed by Skils&rsquo;kin, eligibility for FMLA leave is limited to a combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month period if the leave is taken for the birth of the employee&rsquo;s son or daughter or to care for and bond with the child after birth; for placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care, or to care for and bond with the child after placement; or to care for the employee&rsquo;s parent with a serious health condition.</p>
<p>If one spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would be entitled to a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave. Where a husband and wife both use a portion of the total 12 weeks of FMLA leave entitlement for one of the purposes set forth above, the husband and wife would each be entitled to the difference between the amount he or she has taken individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for a purpose other than those set forth above.</p>
<p>If the need for FMLA need is foreseeable, an employee must provide at least 30 days&rsquo; notice before FMLA leave is to begin. If 30 days&rsquo; notice is not possible, notice must be given as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Employees who request leave for their own or a family member&rsquo;s serious health condition must provide medical certification of the serious health condition. Employees must also provide medical certification indicating that the employee is needed to care for the family member.</p>
<p>Employees taking FMLA leave for their own serious health conditions must provide medical certification stating that they are unable to perform the essential functions of their job. Before returning to work following leave, the employee must also submit a medical fitness for duty certification indicating the employee&rsquo;s ability to work and any limitations.</p>
<p>Leave for the birth or the placement for adoption or foster care must conclude within 12 months of the birth or placement.</p>
<p>For purposes of confirmation of family relationship, the employee giving notice of a need for leave may be required to provide reasonable documentation or statement of family relationship. This documentation may take the form of a simple statement from the employee, or a child&rsquo;s birth certificate, a court document, etc., as Skils&rsquo;kin deems appropriate.</p>
<p>While an employee is on leave, Skils&rsquo;kin will continue the employee&rsquo;s health benefits during the leave, at the same level and under the same conditions of payment as if the employee continued to work. Any planned changes, (e.g., in coverage, premiums, deductibles, etc.) which apply to all employees of the workforce would also apply to an employee on FMLA leave.</p>
<p>If an employee fails to return to work after the employee&rsquo;s FMLA leave entitlement has been exhausted or expired, the employee will be required to reimburse Skils&rsquo;kin for any portion of the employee&rsquo;s premium paid during the leave. However, when an employee fails to return to work because of a continuation or onset of a serious health condition, the employee will not be required to reimburse Skils&rsquo;kin for premium payments made.</p>
<h4>Payment during FMLA Leave:</h4>
<p>If an employee has accrued paid leave, the employee must use paid leave first and take the remainder of the 12 weeks as unpaid leave. Vacation, sick, or PTO leave will be used for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the birth of a newborn child</li>
<li>to care for and bond with a newborn child</li>
<li>placement of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care and to care and bond with the child after placement</li>
<li>to care for the employee&rsquo;s spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition;</li>
<li>because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee&rsquo;s job;</li>
<li>to care for the employee&rsquo;s spouse, son daughter, parent, or nearest blood relative who is a member of the Armed Forces who suffers injury or illness while on active duty; and,</li>
<li>because of a &ldquo;qualified exigency&rdquo; that required the employee to take leave due to a spouse, son, daughter, or parent being on active duty or having been notified of an impending call to order or active duty in the Armed Forces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once an employee&rsquo;s paid leave is exhausted, any additional leave under FMLA will be taken as unpaid.</p>
<p>Vacation and sick leave benefits continue to accrue during an employee&rsquo;s vacation time as well as during any paid leave of absence. &nbsp;Vacation and sick leave benefits do not accrue during the unpaid period of any leave of absence.</p>
<p>Holiday pay will not be granted for holidays which occur during the leave of absence.</p>
<h3>State Family Care and Leave Provision</h3>
<p>For employees working in Washington State, Washington State&rsquo;s Family Care Act requires employers to allow employees to use accrued vacation, sick or PTO to care for sick family members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Family members&rdquo; include the following: (1) Children under 18 with a health condition that requires treatment or supervision; (2) a spouse, parent, parent-in-law, or grandparent with a serious health condition or an emergency condition; and (3) adult children incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental disability.</p>
<h3>Pregnancy Disability Leave</h3>
<p>Employees will be granted leave for absences associated with pregnancy or childbirth. A pregnant employee may work if her doctor states she may work. Following delivery, the employee must have a written authorization from her physician stating she is able to resume working. An employee on pregnancy disability leave is required to first use available paid vacation leave, sick leave, or other PTO. Any additional leave required, if any, will be unpaid.</p>
<p>Pregnancy disability leave will be allowed for time off before delivery and for time off after delivery not to exceed six weeks unless additional time is requested and supported with a doctor&rsquo;s statement indicating inability to work.</p>
<p>Skils&rsquo;kin will coordinate with employees to determine periods where the employee is unable to work because of pregnancy or childbirth. Leave in excess of six (6) weeks following childbirth will be granted only when the period of actual disability (inability to work) relating to childbirth extends beyond six (6) weeks. In that case, leave will continue until the end of the actual period of disability. If the employee returns to active, full-time employment at the end of the six (6) weeks of leave, or at the end of the actual period of disability relating to childbirth, the employee will be permitted to return to the same job or a similar job at the same rate of pay and benefits. Business necessity may require departure from this policy. If the employee elects leave for longer than the actual period of disability, the employee&rsquo;s return to employment will be at Skils&rsquo;kin&rsquo;s sole discretion.</p>
<p>We ask that pregnant employees provide notice of their anticipated leave requirements as soon as they are able to do so by contacting Human Resources to discuss leave needs. This allows the employee&rsquo;s department to plan for the employee&rsquo;s absence and facilitate a smooth transition back into the workplace upon completion of the leave.</p>
<h3>Military Leave of Absence</h3>
<p>In general, service members must provide advance written or verbal notice to their employers for all military duty unless giving notice is impossible, unreasonable, or precluded by military necessity.</p>
<p>Employees required to attend annual military reserve training or other short-term active military duty may take the time as either regular vacation or unpaid leave. Reserves are entitled to return to their jobs as provided by federal and state law. For military service of less than thirty-one days, health care coverage continues as if the service member had remained employed.</p>
<p>An employee who enters the state or federal armed services for an extended tour of duty is eligible for an extended military leave of absence, which may continue up to five years. &nbsp;Employees may (but are not required to) receive all accrued vacation pay as soon as their extended military leave begins. An employee who leaves work to serve in the military is entitled to re-employment consistent with relevant state and federal laws. Such employees are required to report to work within the time frames set forth by applicable federal and state law. Individuals performing military duty of more than 30 days may elect to continue employer sponsored healthcare for up to eighteen months. Such employees may be required to pay up to one hundred and two percent of the full premium. All pension plans are protected.</p>
<p>The Washington State Military Leave Act allows spouses of military personnel who work 20 or more hours per week to take up to 15 days unpaid leave while their spouse is on leave from deployment or before and up to deployment. Leave is unpaid, but employees may elect to substitute accrued paid time off if available. Upon return from leave, employees must be returned to the same or an equivalent position with respect to pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment. Leave is available only during times of military conflict declared by the President or Congress.</p>
<p>An eligible employee who wants to take a military leave related to the deployment of a family member must notify his or her supervisor in writing within five (5) business days of receiving a spouse&rsquo;s notice of an impending call to duty, an order to active duty, or a leave from deployment. Employees may be required to provide a copy of a spouse&rsquo;s military orders upon request by their supervisor.</p>
<h3>Domestic Violence Leave</h3>
<p>The Washington State Domestic Violence Leave Law allows victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking to take leave from work, paid or unpaid, to take care of legal or law enforcement needs and obtain healthcare. Family members of the victim may also take reasonable leave to help the victim obtain treatment or seek help.</p>

<p>The employee&rsquo;s coverage under any health insurance plan will be maintained during the duration of the leave at the level and under the conditions coverage would have been provided if the employee had not taken the leave.</p>
<p>Employees who request Domestic Violence leave must provide five (5) days advance notice in writing. If the employee cannot give five days advance notice because of an emergency or unforeseen circumstances due to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the employee or employee&rsquo;s designee must give notice by the end of the first day of leave.</p>

<h3>Jury Duty</h3>
<p>Serving on a jury is a fundamental responsibility of citizenship and, unless business necessity requires it, Skils&rsquo;kin will not ask you to be excused from or postpone jury duty. If you are serving on a jury, you will be paid, up to a maximum of 10 days, the current rate of pay for your time on jury duty with the expectation that you will remit the pay you receive from the courts minus your mileage reimbursement to our front desk where it will be logged and a receipt will be provided. You are expected to work your regular work schedule on days when court is not in session and work the remaining part of your scheduled shift if you are excused from court for 4 hours or longer. To be entitled to jury duty leave and pay, you must present to the Human Resource Department, your summons for duty and a letter or check stub from the Court Clerk showing evidence of jury duty pay and time served within one week of receipt.</p>
<p>Under state or federal law, Skils&rsquo;kin must continue to pay the salary of exempt employees while they are on jury duty or in attendance as a witness if the exempt employee&rsquo;s absence is for less than a full workweek. If the exempt employee is absent for the entire workweek, then Skils&rsquo;kin need not pay salary for that week, except as set forth herein.</p>
